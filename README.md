# DICTIONARY
## ABOUT

<img align="right" src="./docs/ansi.png" alt="ansi C" width="100" />

Simple library with a few functions for creating simple dictionaries (referred to as "words" in this library).You can test yourself with some words, and the library will provide you with some results. The library is written in plain C99 with no vendor libraries.

### Some funtionalities

- Creates and visualizes a dictionary
- can put you to the test using lectures and provide you with results.
- will put you to the test using the entire dictionary (= word)
- enables you to create new lessons.
- Check for duplicates.

## How to run this code
The program uses CMake as its build tool, but you can use a much simpler and more pleasing way, and that is to use Visual Studio or CLion directly with their imbedded CMake support. Simply open the folder through VS or CL and configure cache, and then you can build and run.

This is a school task, which may appear on the final maturita exam, that was assigned to my class by Mrs. Ing. Bozena Ralbova, my programming teacher, and has a deadline of January 31, 2023.Â 

<br>

## Task given:
Create a program to work with a dictionary that represents a text file. On each line there is an Cyech word, an English word and a lesson number, all separated by a suitable separator. A word can be a general phrase(withspaces). In Czech words, for simplicity, we do not use hooks,...
	
> NOTE:  Create a user-friendly menu

1. TRANSLATION AJ CZ, CZ AJ
    - It can translate a given word
    - Separate function
    - Treat error conditions
    - Solve upper / lower case problem
2. VOCABULARY TEST FROM ONE LESSON
    - Lists all the Czech words from the lesson in turn and  foreach one expects its
	translation, immediately lists correct / wrong
	- Separate function
	- Treat error conditions
	- Solve upper / lower case problem
	- List testing statistics
	- Time limit for testing can be added
3. RANDOM TESTING FROM THE WHOLE DICTIONARY
	- The user specifies how many words he wants to select
	- The program randomly generates a specified number of words and allows testing
	- The words are not repeated
	- Recommendations (good to do at the beginning of random   testing) Create a custom function to determine the number of words in the dictionary, Generate 1 random number(= word order in the dictionary) and do testing for 1 random word
	- Separate function
	- Treat error conditions
	- Solve upper / lower case problem
	- List testing statistics
4. ADDS A WORD TO THE FILE
	- Adds the Czech word, English word and lesson number in the desired format to the end of the file
	- We only add a word if it is not in the dictionary
	- Separate function
	- Treat error conditions
	- Solve upper / lower case problem
5. EDIT EXPRESSION IN THE DICTIONARY(premium task)
	- Separate function
	- The function corrects a dictionary error(overwrites the wrong expression)
	- Another option - removes the entire line containing the specified word from the
	  dictionary
	

## How to read this file

To navigate in the .h document, you have to know some basic convetions

### Naming convetions

|convention|where is|example|
|---------|--------|-------|
|dicXxxxx|function name|dicCreateD(...)|
|DicXxxxx|struct/enum/union name|DicLanguage|
|DIC_XXXX|enum/macro value|DIC_FETCH_CONSOLE|

### File convetions
> Same as CSV(MS_DOS)

|line|content|example|
|-|-|-|
|1|lesson;[*from*];[*to*]|lesson;cs;en|
|2|[*lesson*];[*from*];[*to*]|2;ahoj;hello|
|N|[*lesson*];[*from*];[*to*]|N;xxxx;xxxxx|

> For **[from]** and **[to]** use valid *ISO-639-1* language code 
      (list of valid codes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

 
## Meaning of some words
|word|meaning|
|-|-|
|dic|dictionary|
|word|an actual dictionary (CSV file)|
|fetch|fetch data from (console, file)|
|word entry|one line in word (one line in the csv file)|
|from|language from which we translate|
|to|language into which we translate|
|lesson|lesson in which we should learn the word (it's really weird, but the task has been given, so...)|
